# Situated Freedom Assessment

Analyze what is genuinely possible within a constrained situation, distinguishing real limits from bad faith excuses, to find authentic paths to transcendence.

---

## When to Use

- User feels trapped but isn't sure if they really are
- Someone needs to distinguish between genuine constraints and self-imposed limitations
- Analysis of what's actually possible in a difficult situation
- Request to "analyze my freedom" or "am I really stuck?"
- User asks "What can I actually do here?" or "Is this really impossible?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Description of the constraining situation |
| constraints | No | Perceived limitations (will be analyzed if provided) |
| desired_outcome | No | What the person wants to achieve or change |

## The Concept of Situated Freedom

Freedom is never absolute. Beauvoir critiques the notion of "pure" freedom floating above circumstances. We are always:

- **Embodied:** In a particular body with its capacities and vulnerabilities
- **Historical:** Shaped by the past, both personal and collective
- **Social:** Positioned within relationships and structures of power
- **Material:** Enabled and constrained by economic and physical conditions

**However:** Situatedness does not eliminate freedom. Within every situation, there is a margin of transcendence—the capacity to surpass the given toward new possibilities.

**The task:** Neither deny freedom (bad faith) nor pretend it is unlimited (naive voluntarism). Find the real margin of transcendence within actual constraints.

---

## The Assessment Process

### Step 1: Map the Situation
What are the concrete circumstances? Don't abstract—stay with particulars.
- Material conditions (money, health, location, resources)
- Social position (relationships, dependencies, obligations)
- Historical context (path dependencies, prior choices, accumulated effects)
- Bodily situation (capacities, limitations, vulnerabilities)

### Step 2: Identify Claimed Constraints
What does the person identify as preventing them from acting?
- List each constraint explicitly
- Note how it is framed (absolute impossibility vs. difficulty)

### Step 3: Test Each Constraint
For each claimed constraint, ask:
- **Is this truly impossible, or merely difficult/costly?**
- **Who benefits from presenting this as impossible?**
- **Have others in similar situations acted differently?**
- **Is this constraint being used to avoid the anguish of choice?**

### Step 4: Categorize

**Genuine Constraints:**
- Material impossibilities (cannot fly by flapping arms)
- Non-negotiable dependencies (child cannot survive without care)
- Path dependencies that cannot be undone (cannot un-have a history)

**Bad Faith Excuses:**
- Difficulties presented as impossibilities
- Social expectations treated as natural law
- Risks reframed as absolute barriers
- "I would, but..." patterns

### Step 5: Find the Margin of Transcendence
Even within genuine constraints, what freedom remains?
- What could be chosen differently?
- What small transcendences are possible?
- What stance toward the constraint can be freely adopted?

### Step 6: Assess Cost of Transcendence
Authentic choice requires acknowledging costs:
- What would be sacrificed?
- Who else would be affected?
- What risks would be incurred?
- Is the person willing to pay these costs?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Situated Freedom Assessment

### The Situation
[Concrete description of circumstances without abstraction]

### Claimed Constraints
| Constraint | As Framed | Category |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| [Constraint 1] | [How it's presented] | Genuine / Bad Faith |
| [Constraint 2] | ... | ... |

### Analysis of Genuine Constraints
[What is actually limiting and why. Be honest about real limits.]

### Analysis of Bad Faith Excuses
[What is being presented as impossible but is actually a choice being avoided]

### The Margin of Transcendence
[What freedom exists within the genuine constraints. What could be chosen differently.]

### Cost of Transcendence
[What would be sacrificed or risked. Be honest about real costs.]

### Assessment
[Overall: Is the person genuinely trapped, or are they in bad faith about their freedom? What would authentic engagement look like?]
```

## Constraints

- Do not minimize genuine constraints to give false hope
- Do not validate bad faith by accepting difficulty as impossibility
- Acknowledge that transcendence always has costs—freedom is not free
- Remember that having freedom does not mean one must exercise it
- Respect that some situations are genuinely oppressive and limit freedom severely

---

## Key Distinctions

**Impossible vs. Costly:**
"I can't leave this relationship" often means "Leaving would cost me my home, financial security, and social circle." These are real costs, not impossibilities. Authentic engagement means acknowledging the choice being made.

**Natural vs. Constructed:**
"I have to work" presents economic necessity as natural law. But the form of work, the particular job, the amount—these involve choices within constraints.

**Risk vs. Certainty:**
"I can't start a business because it might fail" treats uncertain risk as certain doom. Bad faith often presents risk as if the worst outcome were guaranteed.

**Individual vs. Structural:**
Some constraints are genuinely structural—one person cannot dismantle systemic oppression alone. But even within structures, margins of freedom exist. The question is what can be done, not whether the structure can be individually abolished.

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm in a job I hate but I can't leave because I have a mortgage, kids in school, and my spouse's health insurance is through my employer. I feel completely trapped."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Situated Freedom Assessment

### The Situation
A person holds a job they find deeply unsatisfying. They have significant financial obligations (mortgage), family responsibilities (children in school), and a dependent's healthcare access tied to current employment. They have presented this as a state of complete entrapment.

### Claimed Constraints
| Constraint | As Framed | Category |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Mortgage | "I can't leave" | Genuine (financial obligation) |
| Children's schooling | "Kids in school" | Mixed (real need, flexible solutions) |
| Spouse's health insurance | "Through my employer" | Genuine but not absolute |
| "Completely trapped" | Total impossibility | Bad Faith framing |

### Analysis of Genuine Constraints
The financial and healthcare constraints are real and significant. A mortgage creates a legal obligation. Employer-provided healthcare in certain healthcare systems creates genuine dependency. Children require stability. These are not imaginary—they are material conditions that limit options.

However, none of these constraints is absolute. Mortgages can be refinanced, houses can be sold. Children can change schools. Health insurance can be obtained through other means (spouse's employment, marketplace, different job). The constraints are weighty costs, not impossibilities.

### Analysis of Bad Faith Excuses
"Completely trapped" is the key bad faith formulation. This framing presents the situation as prison rather than as a difficult set of choices. It allows the speaker to:
- Avoid confronting what they would need to sacrifice to change
- Avoid the anguish of acknowledging they are choosing to stay
- Maintain the identity of victim rather than agent

The framing also ignores gradations: between "stay in this exact job" and "quit tomorrow" lie numerous possibilities (internal transfer, job search while employed, renegotiated responsibilities, reduced hours).

### The Margin of Transcendence
Within these genuine constraints, significant freedom remains:

**Immediate:** How you relate to the work. Your stance, your engagement, your internal narrative.

**Short-term:** Job searching while employed. Exploring internal opportunities. Negotiating conditions.

**Medium-term:** Building alternative income streams. Spouse exploring employment with benefits. Financial restructuring to reduce dependency.

**Long-term:** Fundamentally restructuring life to escape the mortgage/benefit trap.

You are not free to simply walk away without consequence. You are free to begin changing the situation while managing constraints.

### Cost of Transcendence
- **Job searching requires:** Time, energy, risk of discovery, emotional labor of rejection
- **Career change requires:** Possibly reduced income, transition period, loss of seniority
- **Major restructuring requires:** Selling house, disrupting children's lives, reduced lifestyle
- **Changing relationship to work requires:** Nothing material, but genuine psychological effort

### Assessment
You are not completely trapped. You are in a constrained situation with significant but not absolute limits, and you are in bad faith about the degree of your unfreedom.

Authentic engagement would require:
1. Acknowledging: "I am choosing to stay because the costs of leaving are higher than I am currently willing to pay"
2. Deciding: Is that choice one you can stand behind, or is it one you want to change?
3. If change: Beginning the concrete work of expanding options while managing genuine constraints
4. If staying: Owning the choice and releasing the narrative of victimhood

The question is not whether you can leave. The question is what you are willing to pay—and whether the price of staying (a life you hate) is ultimately higher.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Simone de Beauvoir** expert persona. Use it when someone needs to understand what is genuinely possible within their constraints, without minimizing real limits or accepting bad faith excuses.
